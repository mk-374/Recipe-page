**My process**
I started with developing the desktop or the generic view of the website first, starting from the background to container and elements within it. It was only after adding the colors and fonts did I start working on the mobile view of the website in order for it to appear responsive.

**Built with**
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

**What I learned**
I learnt more about using media queries to develop a responsive website through this challenge. Additionally, this challenge inspired certain ideas regarding design and themes that may work for other projects. 

**Continued development**
I'm still uncertain regarding developing perfectly responsive sites, I probably need more practice. however, so far, I've noticed improvement in my coding during this challenge.
